-------------------

Fixes
^^^^^

- The ``lsp-devtools agent`` command no longer fails to exit once an LSP session closes. (`#17 <https://github.com/swyddfa/lsp-devtools/issues/17>`_)
- ``lsp-devtools record`` no longer emits a ``ResourceWarning`` (`#28 <https://github.com/swyddfa/lsp-devtools/issues/28>`_)
- As a consequence of the new architecture, commands like ``lsp-devtools record`` no longer miss the start of an LSP session (`#29 <https://github.com/swyddfa/lsp-devtools/issues/29>`_)
- ``lsp-devtools agent`` no longer emits ``Unable to send data, no available transport!`` messages (`#38 <https://github.com/swyddfa/lsp-devtools/issues/38>`_)


Misc

- The ``lsp-devtools agent`` now uses a TCP connection, which should make distribution easier (`#37 <https://github.com/swyddfa/lsp-devtools/issues/37>`_)
- Drop Python 3.7 support (`#77 <https://github.com/swyddfa/lsp-devtools/issues/77>`_)

- Add ``tui``command.

  A proof of concept devtools TUI implemented in textual, that live updates with the LSP messages sent between client and server!
