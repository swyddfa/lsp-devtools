If a client's capabilities has been set, pytest-lsp will automatically check the server's response to see if it is compatible with the capabilities the client provided.

If an issue is detected, pytest-lsp will emit an ``LspSpecificationWarning``

**Note:** This relies on a dedicated ``check_xxx`` function being written for each request so only a subset of the LSP spec is currently supported.
